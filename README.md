# Puppet Extension for Visual Studio Code

The Puppet Extension for Visual Studio Code offers rich language support for Puppet DSL, snippets, and linter for [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com).

## Requirements
This extension relies on [puppet-lint](http://puppet-lint.com/) to check your Puppet code. Use Ruby `gem` to install:

```
sudo gem install puppet-lint
```

## Features

### Syntax Keywords
- Puppet DSL Syntax

### Snippets
- augeas
- case
- cron
- define
- exec
- fail
- file
- file_line
- group
- if
- elsif
- else
- mount
- node
- package
- service
- unless
- user
- yumrepo
- versioncmp
- zfs
- zpool

### Configure Checks

Checks are performed via `puppet-lint`. To enable or disable certain checks different from default create a `~/.puppet-lint.rc` file in project root. Add switches, one per line. For full list of switches run `puppet-lint --help`.

Example:
```
--no-80chars-check
--no-case_without_default-check
```
